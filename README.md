# 🎰 Spin Machine Game (3x3) – Python Project

## 📊 Project Overview
This is a **command-line based 3x3 Spin Machine Game** created using **Python**, where users play with randomly generated symbols (`r1`, `r2`, `r3`, etc.). The player spins the grid, and if any row has matching symbols, they win rewards. The game includes a betting system, balance updates, and continuous play until the user exits or the balance runs out.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Random module** – for generating spin outcomes
- **Functions & loops** – to structure game logic
- **Terminal-based UI** – for text interaction

## 🎮 Game Features
- Generates a **3x3 matrix** of random symbols like `r1`, `r2`, `r3`
- Implements **win logic** for matching rows
- Includes a **balance system** where each spin costs money and wins provide rewards
- Allows **multiple game rounds** with user-friendly prompts
- Displays results after every spin with updated balance

## 📝 Sample Output
Spinning...

r1 r2 r3
r2 r2 r2 ← Match! r3 r1 r1

🎉 You won ₹50! Balance: ₹90


## 🚀 Learning Outcomes
- Practiced core Python concepts: **lists, randomization, conditionals, and user input**
- Developed a **modular and replayable game structure**
- Strengthened understanding of **game loops and logic building**

## 📎 How to Run
1. Download or clone the repository  
2. Run the file in terminal or IDE:
   ```bash
   python spin_machine.py
